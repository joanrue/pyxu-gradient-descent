Welcome to the official API reference for Pyxu, your go-to library for cutting-edge scientific computing in Python. This
API documentation is intended to serve as a comprehensive guide to the library's various modules, classes, functions,
and interfaces, providing you with detailed descriptions of each component's role, relations, assumptions, and behavior.
Please note that this API reference is not designed to be a tutorial; it's a technical resource aimed at users who are

.. The goal of this page is to provide an alphabetical listing of all Pyxu objects exposed to users.  This is achieved
.. via the `autosummary` extension.  While `autosummary` understands `automodule`-documented packages, explicitly
.. listing a module's contents is  required.
